## Building

Building the program is as simple as:

```bash
make build
```
or in Production mode

```bash
make build-prod
```

After building, it's a good idea to test it by

```bash
make test
```

If you are too lazy, just

```bash
make all
```

## Developing

To use the program in DEV mode and allow CORS for testing, run

```bash
make run-dev
```

Or if you have built the program and simply want to run it, do
```bash
make run
```
